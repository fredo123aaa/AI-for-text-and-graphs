# 🧠 AI for Text and Graphs

This repository contains practical labs and experiments exploring **Artificial Intelligence methods for text and graph data**, as part of coursework and personal research. The project is currently **in development** and will evolve over the coming weeks.

---

## 📘 Overview

The repo contains Jupyter notebooks that apply and analyze a variety of **machine learning and deep learning techniques** to structured (graphs) and unstructured (text) data.

The objectives are:
- To explore **representation learning** for textual and graph data.
- To understand and implement **graph neural networks (GNNs)** and **natural language processing (NLP)** models.
- To compare classical and neural approaches for learning and prediction.
- To document the learning process and results progressively.
